# topshelfre take home assessment

Dear enthusiastic candidate. Thank you for agreeing to take our assessment.

## Instructions
1. You are given a boilerplate code in the language of your choice. Read it and ask questions that you may have.
2. You may consult online resources but not AI tools.
   * While AI may enhance the speed of development, we would love to hire engineers who know enough to be able to use AI as a tool.
   * While we won't use any tools to detect the use of AI, we'd love for you to challenge yourself. After all, we know that no one knows everything but with the right attitude and a hunger to learn, many could do well.
4. Create a fork of this repo.
5. Add functionality and add tests on top of what have been pre-written.
6. Not only optimal code but well organized code will be appreciated (bonus points)
7. Send us the fork, once you are ready and add @varunturlapati as a contributor (to review the code).
   * Include instructions for installing dependencies and running on an IDE like VSCode, if you can.
   * If you are able to containerize it and include instructions to run the service in a container, we'll be even more excited, but not doing so won't count as a failure.
9. If we liked what we see, we'll have another interview to go over systems design and architecture as part of the technical assessment.

Good luck!

## Notes
1. This is meant to be a self-sufficient assessment. There are no other files or attributes or services defined or necessary to get started.
2. If you feel stuck about what attributes an object/resource might contain, it would be a good idea to start by trying to make the tests pass. The tests may contain implementation hints.


## Time
You may take no more than 3 hours to complete the assessment.
